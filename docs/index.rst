NIRVANA: Nonaxisymmetric Irregular Rotational Velocity ANAlysis
===============================================================

NIRVANA forward models galaxy velocity fields using a second-order
nonaxisymmetric model. This enables it to reproduce bisymmetric features
like bars. It also accounts for beam smearing and velocity dispersion in
the resolved spectra. 

MaNGA-NIRVANA will be a Value Added Catalog included in SDSS Data
Release 17, the final data release for the SDSS-IV project MaNGA. It
will contain rotation curves for several thousand rotating galaxies in
the local Universe with quantified maps of bisymmetric irregularities.
